# One Book Millionaire Challenge

You know Code Scribes is technically a coaching business so why the f*** am I not reading and studying coaching programs.

## Day 1 - Finding my why
Why is this book so important?
    Getting focused early is getting a leg up on anyone else in the industry but CS is such a wide field how does someone who doesn't know anything choose what to learn.

The book won't make me a millionaire but it'll lead to coaching etc. that can make me a millionaire.

**Start With Why:** Simon Sinek 
 - [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&vl=en)
 - [Book](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/start-with-why-simon-sinek/1016513563;jsessionid=D080C878406DD1AD1B0BBC7BE039CAA9.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781101149034)

Maybe :thinking: Code Scribes Compass - A compass for navigating the sea of technical decisions at a start-up.

**Homework**
    - Choose the subject for Code Scribes Compass
    - List Pro's and Cons for both.

**Option 1:** A book for new/aspiring software developers that details the different fields of software development, what the job responsibilities are and what technologies they would most likely need to study
In each chapter I should include
 - Additional learning resources (Books, Blogs, Courses etc.)
 - What coding interviews are like for that role
 - what conferences exist for that role
 - what companies, tools and products exist for that industry
Maybe include a chapeter on the standard hiring process <- kinda like cracking the coding interview though

## Day 3 - Outline Epiphany
   - this if your teaching framework. You need to be an expert in this subject

your passion means nothing w/o process

The reason I’m writing my book….It’s incredibly hard and kinda awkward to find let alone ask someone to be your mentor, especially in a vast field like software development. A lot of people coming straight out of bootcamps etc. don’t even know a direction to start walking. My book will at least give them a direction.

Run test adds with
 - Book titles
 - Pain Points
 - Value props

let the most popular ad determine what you use.

if you guess more than you test you'll be one of the broke ones.

In pursuit of that I tried to master (enumerate techs) at my 1st job out of college and succeeded in gaining profeciency in about 4 of them. If I just focused on the ones most important to my job I could have achieved the expertise I craved and probably performs better at my job resulting in faster career advancements and mo $$$$.
