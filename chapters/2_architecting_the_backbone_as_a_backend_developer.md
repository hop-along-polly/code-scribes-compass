# Chapter 2 - Architecting the Backbone as a Backend Developer

`Writing Style`: Conversational
`Personal Story`: Imagine the first thing you did as a professional software developer was bringing a critical application of a multi-million dollar company to a screeching halt. That's exactly what I did at my first job out of college. Back then I was working on an ETL application, which is a fancy way of saying a lot of data was moved around and enriched with data from other sources on a regular basis. Customers had basically 0 interaction with the ETL application but when it wasn't processing any data, like it was because of my code, everyone knew. The director of engineering, and my direct manager, was the person that brought the error to my attention and thankfully was able to point out exactly what I had done that brought down the backend data processing portion of the business. The error was easily fixed within the hour but had it been allowed to persist customers would have started to notice which could have led to significant business liabilities due to breach of contract. I'm reminiscing about this story not because I'm proud of if but because it paints a picture for how important backend development is. Customers who essentially didn't know the backend ETL application even existed would have been severely and negatively impacted if it wasn't running properly. This is the nature of backend development. For a more relatable explanation I'll use the analogy of buying a car. When buying a car most people consider things like, price, how comfortable the seats are, how it drives, if the car fits all the stuff they want/need to pack into it, and if they like how it looks. In this analogy these are "frontend" features and without them you won't even consider buying the car. In most cases buyers won't even ask the question, "does it come with an engine?" which is an incredibly important question. What good is a sharp looking car, that fits all your luggage, and is within your budget if the car can't go anywhere. The engine is a "backend" feature. As long as it's there and working properly nobody notices or really thinks about it, but as soon as there's a problem with it everything else becomes a second priority. This is the same with software. It doesn't matter how good the UI is, if the backend is down all those carefully crafted workflows and features in the frontend won't function, just like the car with no engine won't function despite it's good price and comfy seats.
