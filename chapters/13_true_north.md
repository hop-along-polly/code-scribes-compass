# Chapter 13 - True North

`Writing Style`: conversational
`Personal Story`: When did I realize my true north. Talk about mentoring Brett & Jordan, teaching UTA bootcamp and tutoring (whats her fuck) who was struggling with her minor degree. For the last story I can talk about how I was literally on a treadmill when I got the call from my VP of engineering asking if I'd help out with it.
