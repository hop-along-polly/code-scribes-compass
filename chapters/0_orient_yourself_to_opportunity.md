`Writing Style`: Conversational
`Personal Story`: When I started my software engineering career I wanted to be an expert in everything. I wanted to know the intricasies of the programming language(s) my company was using better than everyone else. I wanted all the other devs to come to me when they were having difficulty writing a complex SQL query. I also wanted to be the guy that was on the bleeding edge of technology and could talk about the latest trends, languages and technologies from a place of authority. To that end I tried to master, C#, PHP, MongoDB, MySQL, HTML, CSS, git/GitHub, AWS, and Docker. I successfully became proficient in about 4 of these topics, which is a far cry from mastery. It wasn't until much later I heard the quote from Malcolm Gladwell, "it takes 10,000 hours to master your craft". This got me thinking how I could most efficiently master my craft. The answer I wasn't expecting to get was that I needed to specialize my skillset and then generalize it. With that understanding I started specializing in backend software development, then I branched into DevOps, and eventually cloud infrastructure and systems architecture. Had I started out with the intense focus on one topic I probably would have reached the level of mastery I craved and probably enjoyed faster career advancement and better raises along the way.
