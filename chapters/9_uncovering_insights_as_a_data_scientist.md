# Chapter 9 - Uncovering Insights as a Data Scientist

`Writing Style`: conversational
`Personal Story`: At the tail end of the crypto currency crash in 2022 OpenAI, a relatively unknown company at the time, launched ChatGPT which was destined to become the fastest growing user application in history. Within the first 5-days of being released ChatGPT already had 1-million users and within 2-months there were 100-million users. Although the Large Language Model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT was only in development since 2018 data scientists had been working on neural networks, deep learning and other machine learning techniques since the early 2000's. Now days applications like ChatGPT, DALLE-2, and MidJourney are ubiquitous and none of them would be possible without data scientists.
