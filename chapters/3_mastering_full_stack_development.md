# Chapter 3 - Mastering Full Stack Development

`Personal Story`: The Inner Harbor Bridge in Copenhagen nicknamed the Kissing Bridge was scheduled to open in 2013. There was one problem though, it didn't "kiss" in the middle. Like most bridges Copenhagen's Kissing Bridge was built from both sides but due to several engineering errors the bridge was misaligned meaning it didn't meet in the middle. This is a great anaolgy for a situation that arises all the time in software development. In this analogy frontend development is one side of the bridge and backend development is the other side. As each team builds their respective part of the bridge they are doing so only thinking about their part. This silo'd view of the project/feature often leads to the frontend and backend systems not meeting in the middle. One such case I got to witnesses first hand while working on a dashboard for an eLearning platform.

If you've worked in any sort of corporate analytics role you've probably seen your fair share of dashboards. For those of you that haven't, a dashboard is a page included in most enterprise software products that shows data using graphs, charts and metrics detailing how the product is being used and how it's providing value to the customer.

In my situation the company had built a frontend UI with all the bells and whistles. If there was data that could be shown as a metric, graph or widget it was shown. The problems started when we built out the backend system for providing the data shown in all the fancy widgets. We quickly realized some of the data needed was being stored in a format that couldn't be represented with the wdiget/graph chosen for it. In other cases we realized the same data was being represented in multiple widgets using terminology that contradicted each other and most egregious of all there were widgets and graphs that needed data that was not even being stored on the backend. Both sides of the bridge had been built but they did not meet in the middle.

This is where full-stack developers have an advantage. Since they understand and work in both the frontend and backend systems they have a wholistic view of what is being built and can get ahead of problems like the ones I experienced. Full-stack engineers also have the ability to fix issues where the bridge is misaligned by adjusting both the frontend and backend which is an incredibly valuable skillset to an organization.

To this day the "Kissing Bridge" in Copenhagen is misalgined by 6-8 centimeters so it doesn't quite kiss but it was completed and is in use. I'd like to think a full-stack engineer helped make that happen.
