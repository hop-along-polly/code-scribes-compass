# Chapter 10 - Shaping the Future with Intelligent Machines

`Writing Style`: conversational
`Personal Story`: Back in 2015, when I was just starting my career as a software engineer, I was working for a company that operated classified advertising website for motorcycles, RV, and commerical trucks. One of the more difficult and technical problems the company faced was taking arbitrary text provided by dealerships describing make, model, and trim of the vehicles in their inventory and making that searchable. The company had developed an application called the Make Model Reconciler to solve this problem, but it wasn't very accurate and there were several use cases where the application would flat out fail. After about a year at the company I was tasked with designing and implementing a new version of the MMR that was at least 90% accurate and handle special uses cases such as "The Great Dodge Ram Split of 2010" that I would affectionately start calling it. Since the MMR was a critical part of the companies overall product the rewrite had a lot of visibility. It wasn't uncommon for multiple VP's and product owners from different divisions to sit in on the demo's for the new Make Model Reconciler. After about a month of working on the MMR project I started to realize the MMR needed to be an AI and not API if it was going to satisfy all of the requirements being imposed by all of the stakehodlers. Reading this now you probably think that should have been easy but keep in mind companies like OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT was founded the same year I was working on the MMR. Now days there are ML Engineers whose specialty is developing, testing and deploying the ML models (AI's) that would have solved exactly the issue I was trying to solve with the Make Model Reconciler.
