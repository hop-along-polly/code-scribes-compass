# Chapter 1 - Decoding the Frontend Developer Path

`Writing Style`: Conversational

`History`: The history of computer programming dates all the way back to the 1830's when Charles Babbage, and English mathematician, published a paper describing the "Analytical Engine" a theoretical digital computer that could perform any arthmetic operation it was instructed to perform via punch cards. It wasn't until 1843 when Ada Lovelace, a French mathematician, provided annotations on how Babbage's Analytical Engine could perform a sequence of calculations. Lovelace's annotations are considered the first computer program making her the first computer programmer ever. While Charles Babbage is regarded as the inventor of the computer, and Ada Lovelace is the first computer programmer, Alan Turing, another English mathematician, is considered the father of modern computer programming. During World War 2 Turing developed and built the first modern computer to decode encrypted messages from the German Enigma machines. **Maybe mention Imitation Game**. It was another 20+ years before the first graphical user interface (GUI) was invented by Xerox, **TODO mention something about the ideation of the internet** and it was almost another 20 years later before HTML, a foundational component of all modern websites was created by Tim Berners-Lee.

This is where our journey begins. While plenty of programming history exists between the 1940's and 1991 the advent of the internet **TODO express Changed Everthing better**


`Personal Story`: I have a love hate relationship with frontend development. I love it because there's something magical about seeing code I wrote render into a webpage that I can interact with. I also love frontend development because it's one of the few tech disciplines where you can show someone without any technical knowledge what you built and they will genuinely share in your amazement. Most of the time i'm forced into doing frontend development I absolutely hate it. It wasn't until I started using React.js, a popular JavaScript framework for FE development, where I started enjoying writing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. One particular feature I implemented stands out as a moment of triumph. I was working with a CyberSecurity company building an Antivirus software and I was on the team building the UI to manage endpoints (laptops, desktops etc.). Customers wanted the ability to export spreadsheets (a.k.a CSV files) of data from different views in the application. Using React.js I was able to build a component that allowed the applications user to
1. Name the file the data would be exported to
3. Select how much data would be exported (i.e. the current items shown, everything that matched the selected filters, or the whole dataset)

As an engineer my favorite feature of this component was that it could be reused in any view that displayed table like data and all the developer would have to do was provide a few basic parameters. Most importantly though the component looked clean and sharp and made it easy for a user to accomplish their goal of exporting data. The balance I was able to find between function and form for this component is exactly what Frontend engineers are supposed to do.
