# Chapter 4 - Harmonizing Code & Infrastructure (DevOps)

`Writing Style`: Conversational
`Personal Story`: Automating a manual task has always been one of the key benefits of a program. Manual tasks are error prone and subject to human error, but even software engineers were dealing with the manual task of provisioning servers, pushing changes into production and updating software until the advent of Developer Operations, DevOps for short. Before the Devops movement started in 2008 developers would either perform DevOps tasks manually or write a script that did those tasks for them, but even then the scripts were not part of an automated process so they could be run with incorrect parameters or out of sequence causing errors. When I first started my career I worked on a web application that was deployed by uploading the compiled source code to a server via FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and logging into a Microsoft IIS Server to make some configuration changes. The entire code base wasn't even in version control so if broken code was deployed the site was just down until someone fixed it. To make matters worse, I was the only person who knew how to deploy the code base. It wasn't until 2015 when I was introduced to DevOps and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) that I realized there was a better way to manage deployments. It was fortunate timing because 6 months later I had to hand off the web application I had been manually deploying for years to a new team of developers. In those 6 months I was able to get the code base into version control, and write a script that automated the deployment tasks so any developer could deploy to production. As a DevOps engineer your job is to smooth the process for developers to get their code into the hands of customers. In my case this meant getting a website deployed, In other cases it could mean provisioning servers, configuring 3rd party services and defining the processes, workflows and standards for an application. I like to think that as a DevOps engineer your customer is another developer.
